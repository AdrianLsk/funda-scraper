# Visualization of trends
The data can also be visualized in time, and used as a gauge of market sentiment. Figure 2 illustrates the development of (most recent) asking prices and the time it takes for properties to sell.

**Figure 2.** Asking prices before sale (above) and days the property was offered on Funda (below) for over 11,000 properties in the period 1 April 2015 - 18 July 2016. The blue dots represent individual properties, the red curves weekly averages, and the green curves (weighted) exponential fits of the weekly averages. 

As seen from Figure 2, over the period observed, the house prices increase on average by 15% per year. Despite that, the average time it takes for a property to sell has more than halved. In short, the Amsterdam real estate market is heating up!
